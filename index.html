          <p> Our minds are involved in any experience we have.
            This can seem quite obvious, but we usually don't realise how much activity happens in our minds every day.
            We know that our routines as developers can be a little tricky with many deadlines to follow up and a lot of
            teamwork that is not always easy to deal with.
            The good news is that we can train our minds to experience these daily situations more happily.
            <br>That's why we created this page as an easy guide to access some mindfulness techniques that you can
            apply every day.
            <br>Enjoy!

          <p>Meditation can be thought of as a way to train your mind. The concept comes from the Sanskrit word Bhāvanā
            (Sanskrit: भावना, also bhāvana) which literally means "development", cultivating or "producing" in the sense
            of "calling into existence". In a more modern translation would problably be something like practice or
            exercice. Scientists have found that practicing maeditation regularly can bring many benefits for you, such
            as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stress reduction</li>
            <li>Stress reduction</li>
            <li>Anxiety control</li>
            <li>Emotional health</li>
            <li>Self-Awareness Enhancement</li>
            <li>Attention Span Becomes Lengthened</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h2 class="meditation-title-two"><strong>How can I get started?</strong></h2>
          <h3 class="meditation-title-three"><b>What matters most is consistency</b></h3>

          <div>
            <p>You can choose to practice daily or some days a week, but even completing one meditation can lead to a
              reduction in mind wondering.
              Scheduling your meditation sessions will help you to create a new habit, like going for an exercise class
              or an appointment.
              Or we could tack it onto an existing routine, like before going to bed or taking a shower.
              If you miss a day or more, there is no problem.
              <br>You can simply pick up where we left off.

          <div>
            <p>You can start with short meditation sessions, which take 5 to 10 minutes.
              Once we have a consistent practice, we can slowly increase our time.
              Set up your alarm or choose a guided meditation video to track your time and enjoy every minute without
              worrying about the time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is a bit challenging for some people to keep their minds quiet for 15 minutes, but by the time you
              will naturally calm your mind down more easily.</p>

            <p>You can meditate sitting in your chair at work or on the floor. You can meditate on your knees or even
              standing.
              What matters most is that you feel comfortable in the position you choose.
            <p>If you choose the chair-sitting meditation, straight your back and put your feet flat on the floor.
              Your head and neck must be in line with your spine.
              You can also place a pillow to support your lower back or under your hips.</p>
            <p>If standing, slightly bend your knees. Try to place your hands on your belly so you can your breath
              moving through your body.</p>
            <p>If kneeling meditation is for you, it will be even easier to keep your back straight. Your shins should
              be flat on the floor with your ankles below your bottom.
              A good tip is to place a cushion between your bottom and heels.</p>

          <p>Mindful breathing is a technique you can practice daily, and it will increase your potential to focus on
            your daily activities as well as prepare you for any challenging situation you can face.
            Focusing on your breath is part of the meditation process but can also be trained as a separate technique
            whenever you feel you need to wind down.</p>

          <h2 id="breath-title-two">4 Steps for Mindful Breathing</h2>
          <p>Let's try a step-by-step exercise to practice the mindful breathing technique:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Find a position that you feel comfortable in and rest your hands.</li>
            <li>Invite your body to relax and notice all the sensations while focusing on yourself.</li>
            <li>Tune into the rhythm of your breath. See if you can feel the sensations of breath, one breath at a time.
              When one breath ends, the next breath begins.</li>
            <li>Stay here for five to seven minutes. Notice your breath, in silence. From time to time, you’ll get lost
              in thought, then return to your breath. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>We have been talking about the term 'Mindfulness' on this page, but now we will briefly discuss how this
            theory originated and its 9 core principles. These principles applied to our day-to-day lives become skills
            we can apply in every situation we face, as we mentioned before.</p>
          <br>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Kabat-Zinn">Jon Kabat-Zinn</a> is an American professor emeritus
            of medicine and the creator of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine,
            Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the founder of <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction">MBSR</a> (mindfulness-based stress
            reduction) program. In his book <i>Full Catastrophe Living</i> Jon Kabat lists nine attitudinal factors that
            constitute the pillars of mindfulness practice:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Nonjudging</li>
            <li>Gratitude</li>
            <li>Patience</li>
            <li>A beginner’s mind</li>
            <li>Trust</li>
            <li>Non-striving</li>
            <li>Acceptance</li>
            <li>Letting go</li>
            <li>Generosity</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>Working on anyone will rapidly lead you to the others. Since together they constitute the foundation upon
            which you will be able to build a strong meditation practice of your own.</p>
          <p>Find below some great explanations about each of these powerful skills by Jon Kabat Zinn:</p>
