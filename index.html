          Our minds are involved in any experience we have.
          This can seem quite obvious, but we usually don't realise how much activity happens in our minds every day.
          We know that our routines as developers can be a little tricky with many deadlines to follow up and a lot of teamwork that is not always easy to deal with.
          The good news is that we can train our minds to experience these daily situations more happily.
          That's why we created this page as an easy guide to access some mindfulness techniques that you can apply every day.
          Enjoy!

        <div id="meditation-txt">Meditation can be thought of as a way to train your mind. The concept comes from the Sanskrit word Bhāvanā (Sanskrit: भावना, also bhāvana) which literally means "development", cultivating or "producing" in the sense of "calling into existence". In a more modern translation would problably be something like practice or exercice. Scientists have found that practicing maeditation regularly can bring many benefits for you, such as:
            <li>Stress reduction</li>
            <li>Stress reduction</li>
            <li>Anxiety control</li>
            <li>Emotional health</li>
            <li>Self-Awareness Enhancement</li>
            <li>Attention Span Becomes Lengthened</li>

            <h2 class="meditation-title-two"><strong>How can I get started?</strong></h2>
            <h3 class="meditation-title-three"><b>What matters most is consistency</b></h3>
            <img id="consistency-pic" src="../assets/images/consistency-pic.png">
            <div>
              You can choose to practice daily or some days a week, but even completing one meditation can lead to a reduction in mind wondering.
              Scheduling your meditation sessions will help you to create a new habit, like going for an exercise class or an appointment.
              Or we could tack it onto an existing routine, like before going to bed or taking a shower.
              If you miss a day or more, there is no problem. 
              <br>You can simply pick up where we left off.
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3 class="meditation-title-three"><b>You just need a few minutes to meditate</b></h3>
            <img id="time-pic" src="../assets/images/time-pic.png">
            <div>
              You can start with short meditation sessions, which take 5 to 10 minutes.
              Once we have a consistent practice, we can slowly increase our time.
              Set up your alarm or choose a guided meditation video to track your time and enjoy every minute without worrying about the time.
            <br>It is a bit challenging for some people to keep their minds quiet for 15 minutes, but by the time you will naturally calm your mind down more easily.

            <h3 class="meditation-title-three"><b>You can meditate anytime, anywhere<br></h3>

            <div>
              You can meditate sitting in your chair at work or on the floor. You can meditate on your knees or even standing.
              What matters most is that you feel comfortable in the position you choose.
              <br>If you choose the chair-sitting meditation, straight your back and put your feet flat on the floor.
              <br>Your head and neck must be in line with your spine. 
              <br>You can also place a pillow to support your lower back or under your hips.
              <br>If standing, slightly bend your knees. Try to place your hands on your belly so you can your breath moving through your body.
              <br>If kneeling meditation is for you, it will be even easier to keep your back straight. Your shins should be flat on the floor with your ankles below your bottom.
              <br>A good tip is to place a cushion between your bottom and heels.

            <h2 class="meditation-title-two">Guided meditation</h2>
            <div>
              Guided meditation are a good way to start and you can get useful tips from experts.
              We have selected some great videos with guided meditation of 5, 10 and 15 minutes.

        Mindful breathing is a technique you can practice daily, and it will increase your potential to focus on your daily activities as well as prepare you for any challenging situation you can face.
        <br>Focusing on your breath is part of the meditation process but can also be trained as a separate technique whenever you feel you need to wind down.
        <br><a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/epdf/10.1152/jn.00551.2017" class="breath-link" target="_blank">A recent study</a> shows that several brain regions linked to emotion, attention and body awareness are activated when we pay attention to our breath.
