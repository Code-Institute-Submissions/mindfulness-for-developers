          Our minds are involved in any experience we have.
          This can seem quite obvious, but we usually don't realise how much activity happens in our minds every day.
          We know that our routines as developers can be a little tricky with many deadlines to follow up and a lot of teamwork that is not always easy to deal with.
          The good news is that we can train our minds to experience these daily situations more happily.
          That's why we created this page as an easy guide to access some mindfulness techniques that you can apply every day.
          Enjoy!

        <div id="meditation-txt" cols="50" rows="15">Meditation can be thought of as a way to train your mind. The concept comes from the Sanskrit word Bhāvanā (Sanskrit: भावना, also bhāvana) which literally means "development", cultivating or "producing" in the sense of "calling into existence". In a more modern translation would problably be something like practice or exercice. Scientists have found that practicing maeditation regularly can bring many benefits for you, such as:
            <ul>Stress reduction</ul>
            <ul>Stress reduction</ul>
            <ul>Anxiety control</ul>
            <ul>Emotional health<ul>
            <ul>Self-Awareness Enhancement</ul>
